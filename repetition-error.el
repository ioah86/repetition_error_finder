;; General Description                          ;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;
;; The main function in this package is "find-repetition-error". It
;; takes a starting point and an end point, and if the section is long
;; enough (i.e. enough words given), it will highlight repetitions,
;; and ask the user either to continue and ignore that repetition, or
;; to quit the search. In the latter case, the current cursor remains
;; at the position, and the user can correct the error, if he or she
;; wants.
;; There are the following functions that can be interactively
;; called.
;; find-repetition-error-whole-buffer:
;;   Runs the function "find-repetition-error" from the beginning
;;   until the end of the whole buffer
;; find-repetition-error-from-point:
;;   Runs the function "find-repetition error" from the current cursor
;;   position until the end of the document. This can be also used as
;;   a way to resume a previously stopped repetition error search
;;   (after the error has been corrected -- or not)
;;
;; Just try to call one of these functions, and the usage is quite
;; straight forward.
;;
;; What do our functions recognize as words:
;;   - Anything fulfilling the following regular expression:
;;     [a-zA-Z]{4,}, i.e. any trailing whitespaces or other symbols
;;     will be ignored.
;; How does the function move forward?
;;   - We always check a block of size 100 (default value, which can
;;     be changed by setting the variable
;;     repetition-error-word-block-size). If nothing is found in this
;;     block, the starting point moves forward by one word and tries
;;     again. This is repeated until either the last 100 words are reached
;;     and nothing was found, or until a repetition error has been
;;     revealed. If the user decides to ignore it and moves forward, the
;;     repeated word in that block will be saved with its position. In the
;;     moment, when the cursor moves forward, all ignored repeated words
;;     will be saved with the information about the block they have been
;;     encountered in. This is done because we don't want to repeatedly
;;     warn the user about repeated words in the same area, and these
;;     word will be ignored for all areas that intersect with the already
;;     considered and ignored one.

;;- Mi 14. Jan 22:30:15 EST 2015:
;;   Initial beta version done.
;;- Mo 2. Feb 11:04:53 EST 2015:
;;   - Added function to find repetition errors starting from current
;;     current cursor position.
;;   - removed save-recursion from find-repetition error function.
;;- Fr 6. Feb 23:23:57 EST 2015:
;;   - Altered the documentation a bit
;;   - General description given of the main functionality.
;;- Do 19. Feb 22:28:18 EST 2015:
;;   - added function get-next-n-words-with-ignore-list
;;   - added function is-point-in-ignore-list
;;   - changed regular expression in
;;     - get-next-n-words-with-ignore-list
;;     - get-next-n-words-from-point
;;- So 1. MÃ¤r 21:47:08 EST 2015:
;;   - changed the function get-next-n-words-with-ignore-list to
;;     actually not even put stuff from ignore-list into the resulting
;;     string. 
;;   - started to write the function
;;     create-ignore-list-for-latex-buffer
;;- So 12. Apr 01:27:47 EDT 2015:
;;   - continued working on create-ignore-list-for-latex-buffer;
;;     changes not tested yet though
;;- Fr 12. Jun 22:36:01 EDT 2015:
;;   - fixed an error in create-ignore-list-for-latex-buffer
;;   - made first test on "real" LaTeX-buffer
;;- Sa 13. Jun 21:06:57 EDT 2015:
;;   - Now two papers can be processed error-less by
;;     create-ignore-list-for-latex-buffer. Small bugfixes were
;;     needed. 
;;- Do 18. Jun 22:16:10 EDT 2015:
;;   - Altered the function find-repetition-error to now also include
;;     an optional parameter ignlist, the ignore-list for certain
;;     types of documents (e.g. LaTeX, etc.)
;;   - added (and rudimentary tested) the functions
;;        find-repetition-error-latex-from-point
;;        find-repetition-error-latex-whole-buffer
;;- Sa 20. Jun 23:36:55 EDT 2015:
;;   - Reduced the complexity of the function
;;     find-repetition-error. If there is an ignore-list, we assume
;;     that it is sorted by the value of the first entry of each
;;     contained list; hence, we can ignore a whole bunch if our point
;;     has exceeded the entry in the ignore-list 
;;- Mi 1. Jul 00:37:29 EDT 2015:
;;   - Created function create-ignore-list-by-regexp
;;   - modified create-ignore-list-for-latex-buffer to also include
;;     math modes given by \begin{eqnarray[*]}..\end{eqnarray[*]}
;;     (resp. align[*])
;;- So 12. Jul 21:11:25 EDT 2015:
;;   - Changed the optimization in find-repetition-error with the
;;     ignore list back again, as I have ambiguous output. Maybe I will
;;     change that back later.
;;   - Added Comment support for create-ignore-list-for-latex-buffer
;;   - DEBUG for begin/end eqnarray.
;;   - found out about new interesting function "match-beginning" and
;;     replaced accordingly
;;   - Put some non-greedy-search for the align and
;;     eqnarray-Thing.
;;- Do 3. Sep 22:36:50 EDT 2015:
;;   - Edited the function create-ignore-list-for-latex-buffer, so
;;     that it uses create-ignore-list-by-regexp to find
;;     commented-out-areas.
;;   - get-next-n-words-with-ignore-list debugged and optimized
;;- Sa 10. Okt 14:55:38 EDT 2015:
;;   - Added tests for update-knowns-list (finally figured out how to
;;     test properly in emacs lisp)
;;   - Added tests for filter-known-words.
;;   - Added tests for is-point-in-ignore-list
;;   - Added Tests for exceeders
;;- So 11. Okt 22:07:23 EDT 2015:
;;   - Added tests for transform-complete-ci-string
;;   - Added test for get-next-n-words-from-point
;;- Mo 12. Okt 12:27:40 EDT 2015:
;;   - Moved the test-files into separate folder and altered the paths
;;     in the tests
;;   - Added tests for get-next-n-words-with-ignore-list
;;   - rewrite of the function get-next-n-words-with-ignore-list to
;;     catch some special cases

"integer->integer(->integer->integer->(listof (list integer integer)))->None
This function will scan the buffer between the character at position
begin and the character at position end for repetitions of certain
words. Begin and end are non-negative integers. Optionally, the user
can also define two integers nWords and minRep, which will make the
function return a finding, if there are more or equal minRep words
repeated in a block of nWords words. The default value for nWords is
100, the default value for minRep is 2, represented by the global
variables repetition-error-word-block-size and
repetition-error-min-occurrence.  If the block does not have nWords
words, then nothing is returned.  If in between, there is a block
found with nWords words and a repetition of minRep, then the repeated
words will be highlighted for the user. Then he or she can decide, if
s/he wants to go to the next repetition error or not using a
command-prompt.
Another optional parameter is ignlist. This is a list containing
intervals in which shall not be searched for repetition errors (There
are e.g. commands in LaTeX inside these intervals, etc...)
